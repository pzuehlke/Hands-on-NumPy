    "\n",
    "### $ 1.1 $ Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pseudo-random__ numbers are generated by one of several algorithms in a\n",
    "deterministic way. Since they are obtained according to mathematical formulas,\n",
    "they are not truly random (hence \"pseudo\"), but these formulas are crafted in\n",
    "such a way that the sequences of numbers that they generate exhibit the same\n",
    "_statistical properties_ as true random numbers. In contrast, true __random\n",
    "numbers__ must be generated through non-deterministic sources, such as the decay\n",
    "of radioctive atoms or (more commonly in practice) electronic noise in hardware\n",
    "circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "True randomness is essential in security for encryption and key generation,\n",
    "where unpredictability is crucial, but by definition it cannot be encapsulated\n",
    "as an algorithm. Despite these important differences, it is common to refer\n",
    "to pseudo-random numbers simply as \"random numbers\", for brevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, all functions that deal with random number generation are contained\n",
    "within the `numpy.random` submodule. It provides a variety of methods to\n",
    "generate pseudo-random numbers from different statistical distributions, perform\n",
    "random shuffling, select random samples and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of the functions for generating random numbers considered below depend on an\n",
    "initial value called the _seed_, which is used to compute not just a single\n",
    "number but a whole sequence of them. To develop some intuition\n",
    "about how these pseudo-random number generators work in general, let's consider\n",
    "one basic mechanism for generating such a sequence.  We begin with a\n",
    "mathematical function $ f $ having the following properties:\n",
    "* $ f $ can be computed quickly.\n",
    "* It spreads values evenly across the range of possible outputs.\n",
    "* It is extremely sensitive to its input, meaning that small changes in $ x $\n",
    "  may lead to large jumps in $ f(x) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting such a function, we generate our pseudo-random number sequence\n",
    "$ (x_n) $ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $ x_0 $ is the initial value, called the __seed__. This seed must be specified\n",
    "  manually, otherwise it will automatically be set by NumPy, perhaps based on\n",
    "  the time in milliseconds since the beginning of the session.\n",
    "* $ x_1 = f(x_0) $;\n",
    "* $ x_2 = f(x_1) = (f \\circ f)(x_0) $;\n",
    "* $\\  \\vdots $\n",
    "* $ x_n = f(x_{n - 1}) = \\underbrace{(f \\circ f \\circ \\cdots \\circ f)}_{n}(x_0) $.\n",
    "* $ \\ \\vdots $\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, if we know the seed and the function/algorithm, then we can easily\n",
    "reobtain the same sequence of numbers. This is valuable for debugging and\n",
    "simulations where reproducibility is a requirement. Here's how we can set the\n",
    "seed for the random-number generator (__RNG__) in NumPy:"
